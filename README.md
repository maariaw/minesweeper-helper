# Minesweeper Helper

This is a course project for [Data Structures Lab, spring 2021](https://tiralabra.github.io/2021_p3/en/). During the course I will build a bot that assists the player in minesweeper by showing preferable moves and can also be set to play the game independently. I am adding the bots to this [minesweeper template](https://github.com/TiraLabra/minesweeper), so only selects parts in the `minesweeper.bot` package will be my code.
