# Minesweeper Helper

This is a course project for [Data Structures Lab, spring 2021](https://tiralabra.github.io/2021_p3/en/). During the course I will build a bot that assists the player in minesweeper by showing available moves. If possible, I will also make a bot that plays the game independently. I am adding the bots to this [minesweeper template](https://github.com/TiraLabra/minesweeper), so only the little ai bots will be my own code. I will try to clearly show in code and documentation what is my work and what isn't.
