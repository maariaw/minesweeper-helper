## Week One

### What did I do?

#### I read through most of the course materials

Also attended the lecture.

#### I chose a topic for my project and familiarized myself with relevant literature.

I found a project report and a thesis by other students of computer science, that will help me in my project. The Studholme report has a step by step description of what the algorithm is supposed to do. It looks mighty complicated, but at least it is a definite guide to follow.

#### I started the project

For this topic, a template was given on top of which my own project is to be built. I cloned the repository, ran the game and was pleasantly surprised to get everything working without a hitch. Then I rummaged around a bit, and gained a seed of understanding of what's happening under the hood. I will need to go through everything more meticulously to be able to integrate my bot into the game, but all in due time. Might be beneficial to expand the current documentation of the template with e.g. a few sequence diagrams of what happens when a player makes a move vs. when a bot is asked for a move.

#### I wrote the specification document

The specification document for this project is quite different from the one I wrote for my previouse course project, which was a calendar app. There I had many features that I wanted to implement, and plans about what the app would look like. Here the aim is very simple, it's the way to get there that had to be described in more detail.

### What did I learn?

I learned about constraint satisfaction problems, although if I have time I will read up some more on them and on NP-completeness. We didn't have time to go through the NP stuff on our Data Structures and Algorithms course, so maybe I'll have to study that material myself.

### What remains unclear?

I will have to think about how to clearly show the work I've done for the project as opposed to all the stuff already in the template. I want to put back up the Travis CI and Codecov badges that came with the template, but I want to make a separate Jacoco badge for my own code, so I can clearly see what my own testing status is.

I don't know how to estimate the O-notation for the CSCSP. I don't know if I **should** be able to. Honestly I didn't try very hard, because trying very hard would basically be me writing pseudocode for the whole thing, and that seems a bit more than what should be required for the first week. I'll see about that next week.

### Hours worked: 8
