## Download and run
Download the executable jar [here](https://github.com/maariaw/minesweeper-helper/releases/latest). Run the program, for example with
```
java -jar minesweeper-helper.jar
```
in the folder that the jar was downloaded to.

## Start a game
Click one of the given difficulty levels to start a game. Alternatively click "Set Custom Board", type in the settings you'd like and then click Use Custom Board. If you'd like to be able to replicate a game, toggle "Use a pre-set seed" on and type in a seed. Using the same seed, settings and first opening square will result in an identical game board.

## Use a bot
After making at least one move on the board, you can ask for suggested moves by clicking "Help (bot)". Squares that are safe to open will be colored green. Squares that are mines will be colored red. Colors will disappear after making a move. If you'd like to see a bot play a game on its own, click "Bot Game" on a newly started game, before making any moves yourself.
